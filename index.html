<ul>
<li>Course: CSE 594: Mobile Web Development</li>
<li>School: CSUSB</li>
<li>Quarter: Winter 2013</li>
<li>Lecture: Tue/Thu 4:00 - 5:50  JB 358</li>
<li>Prerequisite: Good programming skills</li>
<li>Textbook: Instructor Web pages and other readings available for free on the Web </li>
<li>Instructor: David Turner</li>
<li>Office Hours: Mon. &amp; Tue. 2:00 - 4:00</li>
</ul><h2>Overview</h2>

<p>We meet twice per week.  In addition to the weekly meetings, you can communicate with the class as a whole by posting to the CSUSB CSE 594 Winter 2013 Google Group.</p>

<p>The course will center around building <a href="https://github.com/csusbdt/webgame">a simple 2D game called webgame</a> that runs in both desktop and mobile environments.  I will present a prototype of a game, and students will develop their own applications using some or all techniques covered.  Students will maintain their code in a GitHub repository and publish their Web applications using Google App Engine.</p>

<p>The main language used in this course will be Javascript running inside a browser.  The course will also rely on a small amount of Java running on the server side. </p>

<h2>Setup Instructions</h2>

<p>Establish a Google account if you donâ€™t already have one.  (Your CSUSB email account is not sufficient.)  Send me your Google account id; I will use this to register you with the CSUSB CSE 594 Winter 2013 Google Group.</p>

<p>Establish a GitHub account if you don't already have one.</p>

<h2>System Requirements</h2>

<p>You can do all required work in this course using any of the three common operating systems: Windows, Mac OS X and Linux.  All required software can be downloaded and installed for free.</p>

<p>You can also use the computers in JB 358 and JB 359 to do all required work in this course. The open times for accessing these labs is available from the CSE website or by contacting the CSE main office.</p>

<h2>Course Goals</h2>

<p>The goal of this course is to increase your understanding of mobile application development that relies on Web technologies. Sub topics of this course include cloud computing, system integration, Javascript, Java, Google App Engine, Git, Eclipse, security, Android SDK, PhoneGap.</p>

<h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learn how to develop mobile applications with Web technologies.</li>
<li>Learn how to develop complex systems using Javascript.</li>
<li>Learn how to develop and deploy scalable applications that use cloud-based application hosting, nosql data stores, third-party authentication and user cloud storage.</li>
</ul><h2>Assignments</h2>

<p>In this course, you will complete programming activities.  The assignments involve research, programming and problem solving. I will grade your performance on programming assignments based on the following criteria.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Readability</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Is source code well-organized? Have unnecessary variables and logic been removed from the code?  Does the indentation and line spacing show logical structure?  Is indentation and spacing done consistently?  Are concerns separated when possible?  Are the responsibilities of components clear and consistently assigned?  Does the code contain names for variables, functions and classes that unambiguously express their purpose in the program?  Are comments included when needed? Are superfluous comments omitted?  </p>

<p>Note that writing a program to produce required behavior is not good enough for a full score in this class: you must also write code that is readable by humans.  Program readability is important because real-world programs are read over and over again in the process of fixing bugs and adding new functionality.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Correctness</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has the student correctly solved the problems?  Is the application interface and internal documentation free of grammar and spelling errors?</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Completeness</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has the student met all stated requirements? </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comprehension</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Does the student understand the work they submitted? Can the student explain the submitted work and answer questions about it?   </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>Timeliness</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Has the student completed the assignment in a timely manner? Were materials submitted by the deadline?  </p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul><h2>Grading</h2>

<p>Your score will be computed by dividing the total of all points earned by the total possible points.  The normal scale will be used to assign a letter grade.</p>

<pre><code>90-100    A
80-89     B
70-79     C
60-69     D
0-59      F
</code></pre>

<h2>Students with Disabilities</h2>

<p>If you are in need of an accommodation for a disability in order to participate in this class, please let me know as soon as possible, and also contact Services to Students with Disabilities at UH-183, (909)537-5238.  You are advised to establish a buddy system and alternate in the class if you require assistance in the event of an emergency. Individuals with disabilities should prepare for an emergency ahead of time by instructing a classmate and the instructor.
Academic Regulations and Procedures</p>

<p>See the CSUSB Bulletin of Courses for the University's policies on course withdrawal, cheating, and plagiarism.</p>

<h2>Computer Science and Engineering Club</h2>

<p>The Computer Science and Engineering Club is a student-run organization that uses a combination of email and campus meetings to plan events, ask and answer technical questions, post job and internship openings, and discuss other topics of interest to computing majors at CSUSB. Club-sponsored events include seminars, workshops, tutoring and fun activities.</p>
